## Introduction

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors.

## What is MIRAGE?

Introducing Multimodal Intelligent RAG Engine for Clinically Grounded Medical Reasoning (MIRAGE), it's a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework purpose-built for clinical reasoning. It intelligently fuses visual features from medical images with dynamically retrieved medical knowledge to boost factual correctness and interpretability.
